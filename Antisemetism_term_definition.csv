Blood libel ,perpetuated accusation that Jews have murdered non-Jews (such as Christian children) in order to use their blood in rituals ,"The blood libel charge—also known as the ritual murder 
charge—has falsely accused Jews of killing and using the 
blood of Christians for ritual purposes since the Middle Ages. 
Blood libels were commonly spread before the Jewish holiday 
of Passover, outrageously asserting that Jews “used the blood 
of Christian children” as an ingredient in ritual breads—an 
association linked to the ancient accusation that Jews are to 
blame for the death of Jesus (see deicide). 
In more contemporary times, blood libel charges evolved 
into a widespread blame of Jews for unconnected murders 
and other horrific crimes—including the modern rumors 
of organ harvesting in Israel (see Figure B1) and Jews (or 
Zionists) eating Palestinian children and drinking their blood 
(see Figure B2).
As one of the longest-standing forms of antisemitism, blood 
libels have led to horrific violence, destruction, persecution, and 
massacres of Jewish people and communities—before, during, 
and beyond the Nazi propaganda that used it to demonize 
Jews. Despite its utter falsehood and its disavowal by Jews, 
the Roman Catholic Church, and other nonreligious authorities, 
blood libel remains an influential myth in the 21st century.","Blood thirsty, ",Indirect,,No,,,"A Canadian metal group is called ""Blood Libel"" and has antisemitism and holocaust denial in their songs.

Cabal,"a small, powerful group that seeks to establish control","Jews have long been accused of being part of a secret group 
that controls the economic and political world order. The 
term cabal originates from the word kabbalah, the Jewish 
mystical interpretation of the Hebrew Bible. Often denoted as 
“Jewish cabal” on social media, it is a dog whistle for Jewish 
control (see control).
Several antisemitic publications and conspiracy theories 
capitalize on this imagery of a conniving cohort, such as the 
Protocols of the Elders of Zion or the New World Order theory 
which is based on the idea that Jews have formed a power 
structure in which they control the media, economy, and politics 
(see Protocols of the Elders of Zion, New World Order).",,Indirect,,Undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 4: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Clannish,"of or relating to a clan; tending to associate only with a 
select group of similar background or status","Referring to Jews as clannish is an antisemitic stereotype 
claiming that Jews only associate and do business with “their 
own kind,” using their power to benefit other Jews and keep non￾Jews from having a fair chance. This accusation has been used to 
label Jews as economically untrustworthy, aggressive, apathetic, 
exclusive, and unaccepting of non-Jews and non-Jewish cultures. 
Similarly, the conspiracy that global Jewish financial firms are 
connected by family ties and work together in an unethical 
manner is known as the “clannish” theory. This false claim 
perpetuates the idea that Jews are “elitists” who work against 
the interest of all non-Jews to gain wealth (see greed). 
The nearly 200-year-old Rothschild conspiracy theory is an 
example of how this “clannish” theme has fueled antisemitism 
throughout history to the modern day. At its core, this theory 
states that a secret clan of Jews under the leadership of the 
Rothschild banking family has been manipulating currency and 
global events for personal enrichment and world domination 
(see Rothschild).",,Indirect,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 5: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Conspiracy theory,"a belief that some covert but influential organization is 
responsible for a circumstance or event","From medieval times until the present day, conspiracy 
theories have spread antisemitic beliefs that blame Jews for 
the world’s worst tragedies. Jews were accused of poisoning 
wells in 14th century Europe causing the Black Death and 
in 21st century America, they were charged with being the 
""hidden hand"" responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
Antisemitism, like all conspiracy theories, is irrational in nature—
unable to be explained by logic or sound reasoning. In his 
1986 book Antisemitism in the Contemporary World, Michael 
Curtis describes how no other group aside from Jews has been 
blamed simultaneously for opposing phenomena: being an 
insular yet cosmopolitan group; for being capitalists and behind 
Communist revolutions; for being subhuman but also a chosen 
people. To conspiracists, conspiracy theories are “self-sealing,” 
meaning any attempt to dispel the theory with logic will serve 
as evidence to the conspiracist of the theory’s existence. Other conspiracies allege Jews are behind their own hate 
crimes, such as the “false flag” theories, and even go as far 
as to say the Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to gain 
sympathy (see Holocaust denial). ",,Direct,,Yes,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 5 and 6: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Control,power or authority to guide or manage,"False reports that claim Jews control the media, banks, 
and governments are part of a longstanding conspiracy of 
secret Jewish power. This antisemitic trope is rooted in the 
discredited publication, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, 
which was published in Russian tsarist times and accused 
Jews of trying to control the world (see Protocols of the 
Elders of Zion). 
These myths of control portray Jews as secret puppet 
masters ruling over others and manipulating the world’s 
economies and governments (see Figure C4). For centuries, 
Jews were blamed for leading “blind” world leaders into wars 
and into debt to enrich themselves and further their own 
hidden agenda (see Figure C5). 
Antisemitic propaganda continues to spread the idea that rich 
or influential Jews are behind the scenes furthering their plans 
of world domination",,Indirect,,Undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 6: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Cosmopolitan elite,"a phrase combining “cosmopolitan,” or representing many 
cultures, with “elite,” referring to the upper class of society","“Cosmopolitan” and “elite” are terms that have separately 
incited antisemites across the political spectrum. Based on 
stereotypes of Jewish wealth and insularity, Jews have been 
accused of being part of an elite class for centuries. In the 
Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, for instance, Jews were 
charged with being “rootless cosmopolitans” and fell victim to 
Stalin’s anti-cosmopolitan campaign where they were arrested 
and tortured. Today, “cosmopolitan elite” is a code word used 
by the far-right to accuse Jews and liberals of controlling 
America and/or being disloyal and unpatriotic by favoring 
internationalism over isolationism.",,Indirect,,Undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 6: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Cowardice,lack of bravery ,"Evolving from the erroneous accusation that Jews lacked 
patriotism (see dual loyalty), in the aftermath of World 
War I, Jews were portrayed as cowardly and weak people 
who actively evaded military service. According to this 
trope, Jews’ inherent cowardice and disloyalty made them 
responsible for national defeats. The apparent Jewish 
meekness in the face of the Holocaust (ignoring the many 
acts of bravery against overwhelming odds) even allowed 
antisemites to claim that Jews contributed to their own 
genocide (see Holocaust denial).",,Indirect,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 7: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Creatures,"animals, as distinct from human beings; fictional or 
imaginary beings","A common form of coded antisemitism includes illustrations 
and images that depict Jews as vermin, tentacled creatures, 
reptilian men, and other “subhuman” monsters. 
Antisemitic rhetoric that dehumanizes Jews laid the foundation 
for the Holocaust, used as rationale by the Nazis to treat them 
as creatures that needed to be exterminated. It appeared in 
Nazi literature and other propaganda to spread antisemitic 
tropes—including Jews as the overlords of global affairs, Jews 
controlling minds, Jews’ quest for world domination, and Jews 
as superior or elite masterminds (see New World Order).
More recently, antisemites such as Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan have referred to Jews as “termites” likening them to 
unwanted pests who multiply rapidly, take over, and destroy 
everything they touch. ",,Indirect,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 7: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Cultural Marxism,"Cultural Marxism is used by most people refers to a kind of behavior that looks for power imbalances in everyday culture (like asking a person where they are from, or complementing a black persons hair) and problematizing those interactions, causing people to resent others for innocuous little social misdemeanors. Cultural Marxism assumes the worst of the actions of a supposedly powerful group by saying that their little faux-pas are really egregious examples of latent prejudice, and excuses the hatred and rudeness of the supposedly weaker group by saying that their behavior is an expression of resisting power or ""asserting their personhood"".","""Cultural Marxism,"" described as a conspiratorial attempt to wreck American culture and morality, is the newest bugaboo on the radical right.""

Deadly exchange,"suggesting Israel is responsible for American police brutality 
due to training programs between U.S. and Israeli police forces","The deadly exchange trope directly compares U.S. police 
actions against Black Americans with the Israeli Defense 
Forces’ (IDF) treatment of Palestinians. Believers in the 
“deadly exchange” allege “worst practices” are shared 
[between U.S. and Israeli armed forces] to promote and 
extend discriminatory and repressive policing practices that 
already exist in both countries, including racial profiling, 
massive spying and surveillance, deportation and detention, 
and attacks on human rights defenders.” 
Users of this trope argue Israeli and U.S. law enforcement 
exchange security practices and ideologies to purposely 
target people of color. This false equivalence appeared in 
demonstrations in the summer of 2020 when protesters 
chanted “Israel, we know you, you murder children, too"" (see 
blood libel). This is categorically false. Accusing Israel or 
Zionists (see Zionists) of complicity in the murder of Black 
people is malicious, perpetuates antisemitism, and blames 
Jews for societal ills (see scapegoat). ",,Indirect,,undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 8: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Deicide,the killing of a god,"Deicide is the charge that Jews bear eternal responsibility 
for the death of Jesus Christ. This claim is based on Matthew 
27:24-25, “His blood be on us, and on our children,” also known 
as the blood curse. This verse (25) has led to more Jewish 
suffering than any other passage in the Christian Bible. 
This source of antisemitism among Christians was only 
refuted by the Catholic Church in 1965, with Nostra Aetate, 
the landmark document that rejected collective Jewish 
responsibility for this crime. Protestant churches have also 
repudiated the deicide charge. Nevertheless, antisemites 
continue to use the charge that Jews killed Jesus to justify 
their anti-Jewish hatred. Additionally, the same wrongful 
accusation and imagery connected with Jews as Christ-killers 
has been recycled in the Middle East, often in the form of 
Jesus representing Palestinians who are “crucified” by the 
Israeli Defense Forces or the Israeli Government. ","Jews are Christ killers,",Direct,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 8: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Dual loyalty,"loyalty to two separate interests that potentially conflict 
with each other, leading to a conflict of interest","Dual loyalty is a bigoted trope used to cast Jews as the 
“other.” For example, it becomes antisemitic when an 
American Jew’s connection to Israel is scrutinized to the 
point of questioning his or her trustworthiness or loyalty to 
the United States (see Figure D4). Dual loyalty accusations 
also occur on U.S. college campuses when Jewish students 
are asked to denounce the actions of the Israeli government 
in order to participate in progressive activities. 
By accusing Jews of being disloyal citizens whose true allegiance 
is to Israel or a hidden Jewish agenda (see globalist), antisemites 
sow distrust and spread harmful ideas—like the belief that Jews 
are a traitorous “fifth column,” meaning they are undermining 
their country from within. The allegation of dual loyalty can 
also be aimed at non-Jews for what antisemites see as being 
“excessively loyal to Israel,” a criticism rarely leveled against 
friends and supporters of other countries (see Figure D5).
For centuries, these antisemitic accusations of disloyalty 
have led to the harassment, marginalization, oppression, and 
murder of Jewish people. ",,Indirect,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 9: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
(((echo))),"an antisemitic symbol used to highlight the names of Jewish 
individuals or organizations owned by Jews","The (((echo))) is part of the coded antisemitism that occurs 
online (see Figure E1). Used by antisemites, neo-Nazis, and 
white nationalists, the triple parentheses are applied to Jewish 
names or topics to identify, mock, and harass Jews in a way that 
is difficult to find in search engines, yet hiding in plain sight. 
While it originated on an antisemitic blog, the (((echo))) went 
mainstream with the creation of a now-removed Chrome 
extension—called ""Coincidence Detector""—that placed three 
sets of parentheses around the names of Jewish individuals, 
of which there were over 8,000 listed. 
This symbol has opened yet another avenue for Jews to be 
targeted with antisemitic messages and even death threats—
but it’s also given some Twitter users a chance to fight back 
by placing parentheses around their names in an act of 
solidarity spearheaded by Yair Rosenberg (see Figure E2). ",,Direct,,undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 9: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
“From the River to the Sea”,"the catch-all phrase symbolizing Palestinian control over the 
entire territory of Israel’s borders, from the Jordan River to 
the Mediterranean Sea","“From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free” is a 
common call-to-arms for pro-Palestinian activists. It calls for 
the establishment of a State of Palestine from the Jordan 
River to the Mediterranean Sea, erasing the State of Israel 
and its people. It is also a rallying cry for terrorist groups and 
their sympathizers, from the Popular Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine (PFLP) to Hamas, which called for Israel’s 
destruction in its original governing charter in 1988.
Sometimes the Palestinian flag emoji is used as shorthand 
for this phrase to spam social media posts related to Jews, 
whether having to do with Israel or not. There is of course 
nothing antisemitic about advocating for Palestinians to have 
their own state. However, calling for the elimination of the 
Jewish state, or suggesting that the Jews alone do not have 
the right to self-determination, is antisemitic.",,Indirect,,undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 10: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Globalist,"a person who advocates the interpretation or planning 
of economic and foreign policy in relation to events and 
developments throughout the world","Much like dual loyalty, globalist is used to promote the 
antisemitic conspiracy that Jewish people do not have 
allegiance to their countries of origin, like the United States, 
but to some worldwide order—like a global economy or 
international political system—that will enhance their control 
over the world’s banks, governments, and media (see control).
The idea of a Jewish globalist was embedded in the 
core ideology of Nazism. Hitler often portrayed Jews as 
“international elements” who “conduct their business 
everywhere,” posing a threat to all people who are “bounded 
to their soil, to the Fatherland.” 
Today, globalist is a coded word for Jews who are seen 
as international elites conspiring to weaken or dismantle 
“Western” society using their international connections and control over big corporations (see New World Order)—all 
echoing the destructive theory that Jews hold greed and tribe 
above country. ",,Indirect,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 10: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
“The Goyim Know”,"a catchphrase used to impersonate and mock Jews and the 
antisemitic conspiracy theories connected to them","“The Goyim Know,” sometimes followed by “Shut It Down,” 
is a popular antisemitic meme based on conspiracy theories 
of manipulative Jews with plans of world domination and in 
control of the media, economy, and governments. 
Typically paired with offensive images of a stereotypical Jew 
talking on a phone or holding a shocked expression (see Figure 
G2), this meme is widely used by white supremacists and other 
antisemites—on sites like 4chan and 8kun (formerly 8chan)—to 
mock a panicked Jew whose secret plot or manipulations have 
been revealed by non-Jewish people, or goyim. 
While “goyim” is a term used by some Jews to refer to non￾Jews, antisemites and white supremacists have weaponized 
the word to mock and accuse Jews of promoting a prejudiced 
support for their own clan.
As it spread online, “The Goyim Know” also made its way 
offline through an antisemitic song parody by the same name, 
as well as the phrase appearing on signs during the “Unite the 
Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Other manifestations 
of the far-right using “Goyim” to mock Jews are the Goyim 
Defense League (GDL) and GoyimTV.com (see Figure G4). ",,Direct,,undetermined,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 11: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Greed,"a selfish and excessive desire for more of something (such as 
money) than is needed","As a foundation for the most constant antisemitic 
falsehoods, the association of Jews with greed has fueled 
antisemitism throughout history and still affects Jews today. 
In the Middle Ages—when Christians were forbidden by the 
Church to lend money for interest—money-lending, trade, 
and commerce were the few professions Jews were allowed 
to have. Jews were blamed for usury, or the act of charging 
high rates of interest, and this association led to stereotypes 
about Jewish greed and wealth. These accusations were 
among the reasons listed by John Earnest, the white supremacist who murdered a Jewish woman and injured 
others in Poway, CA in 2019. From Shakespeare’s sinister 
Jewish caricature in The Merchant of Venice to Rothschild 
schemes of world domination (see Rothschild) to Nazi 
propaganda on Jewish economic control, the antisemitic 
trope of greed can be found in everything from pop culture 
to deep-web conspiracy theories. 
The theme of greed in antisemitic rhetoric is so widespread 
that it’s led to a long list of Jewish stereotypes, including 
being excessively materialistic and money-oriented, 
exploiting others for personal gain, being overly wealthy, and 
controlling the world’s finances (see Figure G5). ",,Indirect,,No,,,,,,American Jewish Committee,Page 11 and 12: https://www.ajc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2021-02/AJC_Translate-Hate-Glossary-2021.pdf,
Holocough,"a call by the far-right to spread coronavirus to Jews to infect 
and kill them","“Holocough” first emerged on white supremacist and neo-Nazi channels on alternative social media platforms as news 
of COVID-19 spread in the U.S. Far-right personality Milo 
Yiannopoulos used “Holocough” in a Telegram poll, and 
the term further spread to Gab, a messaging platform with 
a large far-right and extremist base, after user Bjundabare 
created an image with the text, “If you have the bug, give a 
hug. Spread the flu to every Jew.”
The “Holocough” finds its roots in the historic practice of 
connecting Jews to sickness, providing antisemites with 
familiar tropes. In the 14th century, Jews in Europe were 
blamed for poisoning wells and causing the Bubonic plague, 
and thousands of Jews were murdered in response; in the 
1890s, Jewish Americans were blamed for the tuberculosis 
outbreak in the U.S.; in the 1930s, Adolf Hitler compared Jews 
to bacteria and disease; and today we are again witnessing 
Jews being blamed for COVID-19 (see poisoning the well).
Ironically, the same people invoking the term #Holocough are 
often the same ones denying the scope and veracity of the

Holocaust denial,"an attempt to negate the facts of the Nazi genocide of the 
Jewish people; a belief that the Holocaust did not happen or 
was greatly exaggerated","Despite endless historical facts, Holocaust denial and 
distortion spread the false idea that Jews invented or 
exaggerated the Holocaust, including the diary of Anne 
Frank, Nazism’s intent to massacre Jews, the use of gas 
chambers in concentration camps, and the murder of millions 
of Jews. Denying the Holocaust, including denying the scope 
or methods used by the Nazis and their allies during the 
Holocaust, is antisemitic.
The term “Holohoax” is a common term for Holocaust deniers 
across the political spectrum, who claim the Jewish people 
exaggerated or made up the Holocaust. The term appears 
on dozens of Facebook groups of every political disposition, 
including extreme-right, anti-Zionist, conspiracy theory 
communities, pro-Palestinian groups, and more (see Figure H3). 
And even when antisemites don’t deny the Holocaust, they 
have used it to attack Jews by accusing them of inventing or 
exaggerating the Holocaust or by comparing its horrors by 
the Nazi regime to defensive actions taken by the State of 
Israel. Claiming that the State of Israel, home to the largest 
number of living Holocaust survivors, behaves like the 
Nazis in its treatment of Palestinians is a personal attack on 
survivors and distorts the meaning of the Holocaust. Likening 
the Gaza Strip, governed by the terrorist organization 
Hamas, to the Warsaw Ghetto, where Jews were confined 
by the Nazis before being transported to death camps as 
part of the systematic massacre of 6 million Jews during the 
Holocaust, or comparing the Israeli Defense Forces to the 
Nazi army (Wehrmacht), is a form of Holocaust denial. There 
is no legitimate comparison between defending the State of 
Israel and ensuring the safety of its citizens to the systematic

Illuminati,groups or persons claiming special religious enlightenment,"Historically, the Order of the Illuminati refers to a secret society

behind global capitalism and Soviet communism (see Jewish
capitalist, Jewish communist) and were plotting to create a New
World Order (see New World Order).
This conspiratorial stance on the Illuminati, as well as its related

Jewish capitalist,"a person who supports the principles of capitalism, an
economic and political system based on private or corporate
ownership of production and profits as opposed to public or
state ownership ","Jews have been accused of puppeteering the world economy for centuries, having been associated with money since the Middle Ages when commerce, trade, and other financial industries were the only professions Jews were allowed to have. As capitalism replaced other traditional forms of commerce, the association of Jews with money remained (see greed). While capitalism and communism are each terms that describe an economic philosophy and worldview that have been embraced by millions of people and served to define the two adversaries of the Cold War which dominated the 20th century, when an adjective is added and the terms become Jewish capitalist or Jewish communist (see Jewish communist), the meanings change. Blaming Jews as “greedy capitalists” or for being at fault
for capitalism’s woes is a form of economic antisemitism.

status and financial behavior of Jews. It can also transcend into

conspiracy theory that states Jews have been behind
communist revolutions around the world. Leon Trotsky was
a political ideologue, who happened to be Jewish, who was
personified by the Russian Czarist government as a symbol
for Jewish Bolshevism (see Figure J4). Nazi Germany invoked
the antisemitic “Judeo-Bolshevism” myth to blame Jews for
Germany’s woes after World War I. While some Jews were
communists and fought in the Red Army during World War
II, labeling all Jews as communists is antisemitic. Another

expression that’s used in everyday vernacular. However, it is
an insulting, antisemitic misrepresentation of Jewish behavior
that plays into the trope of Jews as greedy money handlers

Jewish features,"antisemitic stereotypes that focus on physical features or
characteristics ","Large curved noses. Curly or red hair. Horns. Dark eyes
with drooping lids. Even though Jesus and all twelve of
his disciples were Jewish, it is red-haired Judas who is
purported to espouse Jewish values of greed and betrayal
(see Judas, greed). From religious woodcuts to inflammatory
publications in the medieval ages, Jewish features like curly
or red hair and hooked noses were grotesquely drawn, fueling
conspiracies that Jews are easily identifiable and subhuman.
The degradation of Jews through fictional facial stereotypes
has been a staple theme in antisemitic propaganda used to
portray Jews as subhuman or disfigured. Stereotypical Jewish
features are still used today—from Internet memes to cartoons
in top-tier news outlets—and they perpetuate the antisemitic
notion that base motives are revealed in ugly features. In
the 2020 Aalst Carnival theme, “UNESCO: Controlled by the
Jews?” Jews are drawn as distorted, red-nosed, and with gold
teeth, furthering the stereotype that Jews are malformed and
associated with money (see Figure J6).
Anti-Zionists also use the common feature of Jews as “white” to
attack Israel as a “white, colonial, settler” power, which ignores
and disavows the identity of millions of Sephardic and Mizrahi

Jewish figures,"the use of public Jewish figures to spread antisemitic ideas
about Jews as an overall group","Much like the age-old theme of blaming Jews for disasters
across the world (see scapegoat), prominent Jewish figures
are often the victim of antisemitic rhetoric that’s actually
being pointed at all Jews.
By focusing attacks on a single person, antisemites create a
coded language in which that person’s name or face becomes
synonymous with dangerous antisemitic conspiracies or
tropes. These can include everything from a Jewish plan for
world domination to a Jewish puppet master who manipulates
international events and creates social conflict for his own gain.
Modern examples of this include rumors that George
Soros—a Hungarian-American of Jewish descent and wellknown billionaire—is paying members of a migrant “caravan” to march on U.S. borders (see Soros). Or when Harvey
Weinstein’s history of sexual abuse is somehow linked to his
Jewish identity, spreading the antisemitic trope of “Jewish

community. While some people use “Jewish Lobby” and
“Israel Lobby” interchangeably and have no antisemitic
intentions when saying “Jewish Lobby,” the phrase serves as
a dog whistle for those who believe Jews control politics (see
control). When “Jewish Lobby” is purposefully invoked to
